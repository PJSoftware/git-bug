# git-issue

Integrated issue handler for git.

I am aware of at least one other `git-issue` project, and `git-bug`, but neither operates the way I prefer, so I am going to attempt to write my own.

It is always possible, as I proceed down this path, that my idea of what I want may change, but for now I want an issue-tracker that works with files (probaby `.md`) within the git repo.
